    <Description>This package includes the extension methods for CheckBoxList in ASP.NET MVC, offering the similar way of handling the model binding as the other ASP.NET MVC types. This package is a straight .NET 5.x port of CheckBoxList.Mvc for .NET Framework 4.x by Stephen Zeng and as such offers the same functionality and usage, just for .NET 5.x</Description>
